# Python solution

This is the solution of the _sumOfTwoNumbers_ problem for the _Python_ language:

## solution

create a simple library function `sum_of_two_numbers(a, b)` this should return the sum of both parameters `a + b`

[see solution](./solution.py)

## run

to run the solution with specific input we have to run the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

then just add two integers separated by line breaks and press `ctrl c` then the sum will be given in the next line.

## test

to test the solution run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests/test_solution.py
```
